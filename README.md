# Intro_To_Drones
General info for getting started with drones

This should give you an idea on how/where to start. I'll see about putting something like this together for your budget range, but the number and type of parts are going to be pretty similar. 

I would highly suggest you watch the Flite Test beginner series: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6IuSFWz4ktvupu_gxw1vn-sjBGOkJFHV
My training playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCuDv3oRKHKtHCKKNgwp105RSoMvR4Ag5
and https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQfofxd5B8YWAmCMOf03_AGQfRlJJ_iTo
to start with while I try to compile something in your price range.
I would also suggest you check out the Blunt Nose Versa: https://youtu.be/MAEnYX4UWB8 and the base Versa: https://youtu.be/yP5omais2oc as I think that the Blunt Nose Versa would be the best cost/performance combo for your budget.
Any way you go, you are going to have to train yourself in some real world pilotage. I can see about stopping by Delta State some weekend and give you a hand on learning to fly. Usually you start with something small, durable, easily repairable, and premade so that you aren't compensating for build errors before you really have a feel for it. This:https://www.hobbyzone.com/rc-airplanes/ultra-micro/hobbyzone/hbz4400.html? was my first fixed wing. You could start with one of these or you could try to get the 3 pack swappable http://store.flitetest.com/3-pack-swappable-speed-build-kit/ and get the more powerful power pack so that you could move it to the Versa when the time comes.
The builder that I was talking about in the presentation was Experimental Airlines, and my most durable fixed wing was the Axon: https://youtu.be/-gFYDk5QFhQ
There are some pros and cons to each. The Flite Test planes can be bought pre cut or your can just download the plans and cut them yourself, but the Experimental airlines designs use a common build technique so they are easy to repair and build without plans and even improvise if needed. 

Let me know if you want to go with a semi pre built like what I specced out below or if you want to do the Experimental Airlines or Flite Test setup. It will highly effect my decision on the parts I suggest.

I thought about it when we were talking about interference, and the Success In FPV playlist is all about RF and interference.


Watch ALL of the videos. They provide an excellent foundation.
